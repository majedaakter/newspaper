		Recently a fear has emerged that Bangladesh may not feature high on the International Cricket Council's (ICC's)
		priorities in the post-pandemic world because of the powerful member countries' commercial interests as they
		inevitably try to recoup losses incurred during the halt in play.

		Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), were not entertaining the notion as they believe, under the new system of the
		World
		Test Championships and ODI League, it would not be possible to keep any country away from cricket too long</p>

		<h2> Iran Calls For Trump’s Arrest Over ‘Brutal Murder’ Of Revolutionary Guard General </h2><br> Iran Calls For
		Trump’s Arrest Over ‘Brutal Murder’ Of Revolutionary Guard General
		Tyler Durden
		Mon, 06/29/2020 – 09:05

		Update (0920ET): Iran’s call for the arrest of President Trump has been dismissed as “a propaganda stunt” by the
		Trump Administration’s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook.

		* * *

		A top Iranian prosecutor has called for the arrest of President Trump and dozens of other Americans for their
		involvement in the “brutal murder” of former IRGC General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.

		According to the AP, “the charges underscore the heightened tensions between Iran and the US since President
		Trump
		unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers,” though President Trump “faces no
		danger
		of arrest.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported Monday that Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr has accused Trump and
		more
		than
		30 other Americans (whom Iran believes were involved in planning and executing the Jan. 3 strike that killed
		Gen.
		Qassem
		Soleimani in Baghdad) of “murder and terrorism charges”. The identities of those other than Trump weren’t
		disclosed,
		however.

		After filing the charges, Alqasimehr on behalf of Iran reportedly requested an Interpol “red notice” be issued
		calling
		for the arrest of Trump and the others, which represents the highest level arrest request issued by Interpol.
		Local
		authorities end up making the arrests on behalf of the country that request it. The notices cannot force
		countries
		to
		arrest or extradite suspects, though they can put subjects at risk of arrest or detention if they travel abroad.

		Interpol hasn’t commented on the requests, suggesting that it isn’t taking Iran’s petition seriously. Interpol’s
		guidelines for red notices explicitly states that the agency can’t get involved in political issues.

		Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s Quds Force (an international arm tasked with coordinating terror attacks in
		accordance
		with Iran’s interests around the world) was killed during the opening days of 2020, kicking off what has been a
		year
		of
		non-stop news and activity as both Iran and the US were soon hammered by the coronavirus as it spread
		internationally
		from Wuhan, China.

		<h2>Oil steady as rise in virus cases offsets better data </h2> <br>

		Oil prices slid on Monday as sharp spikes in new coronavirus infections around the world forced some countries
		to
		resume partial lockdowns, raising concerns about the pace of economic recovery and fuel demand.

		Brent crude had dropped 44 cents, or 1%, to $40.58 a barrel by 0917 GMT, and U.S. crude was 36 cents, or 1%,
		lower
		at $38.13.

		“Both contracts are coming under stronger pressure this morning as the spectre of lockdowns returns,” said JBC
		Energy.

		The death toll from COVID-19 surpassed half a million people on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally.

		Countries like the United States, India and Brazil are experiencing a resurgence in infections, leading
		authorities
		to partially reinstate lockdowns, in what experts say could be a recurring pattern in the coming months and into
		2021.

		“Looking ahead, anxiety is likely to remain heightened as the epic fight against the coronavirus pandemic
		continues.
		This spells bad news for risk assets (such as oil) which will inevitably remain under pressure,” said Stephen
		Brennock of broker PVM.

		Oil prices were also under pressure from poor refining margins and high inventories, analysts said.

		Still, Brent is set to end June with a third consecutive monthly gain after major global producers extended an
		unprecedented 9.7 million barrels per day supply cut agreement into July, while oil demand improved after
		countries
		across the globe eased lockdown measures.
